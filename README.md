# public-examples
Examples of my C++ work for public review. These folders contain code snippets that I feel are of particular pride or interest from some of the projects mentioned in my portfolio that I am currently unable to make fully public. 

* Advanced Programming for Games: 
    * Computational solution for the 15-puzzle problem: for any configuration of a 15-puzzle, count the number of complete continuous rows and columns (including reversed), along with smaller chains of continuous numbers.
    * My generic thread-safe file handler to prevent lag in computation time with repeated opening and closing of the solution file to write to. 
* Advanced Graphics for Games: 
* Advanced Game Technologies:
